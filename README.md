# What is mastofind.me?
This website provides an easy way to link to your Mastodon profile for others, without other people ending up on a different server from their own<br>
I.E it solves the problem of me sharing a mastodon.social/@JayBigGuy10 link to a user of mstdn.social, spacey.space or any other server, where they would have to copy my @username@server to their own app or website<br>
Your server and username are stored in your own local browser

Links I used to kitbash this together in one day

Things i'm considering / todo
- option to auto-redirect or not?
- do auto dark mode through css preferred @media query
- maybe a list of all known servers https://codepen.io/shannonmoeller/pen/OJMRrdo
